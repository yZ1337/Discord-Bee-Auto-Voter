## How To Use

_This works best with good proxies!_

1. Clone this github
```
git clone https://github.com/yZ1337/Discord-Bee-Auto-Voter.git
```

2. Install Python libraries needed
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get the `server` id and `d` id:
First go to your voting page of your Discord server.
Do `ctrl + i` in your browser and click on the network tab.
Now click on the vote button.
And get the following 2 id's:

5. Put id's in `info.json`

6. Add proxies to `proxies.txt`

7. Run it and enjoy :)
```
python3 discordbee.py
```

The website discordbee.com is very slow. This is why the script will take multiple seconds to do 1 vote.
